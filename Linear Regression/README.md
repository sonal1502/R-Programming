                                                           Linear Regression

In this project, we use linear regression to build a relationship between the height and weight of people. 

Here we have two vectors 
x and y with the height and weight of 10 candidates respectively. After creating the linear regression relationship, we can now test it. 


Hence, we have used a value 6.3 as the height and when the result is printed, we get the predicted weight of a person of the following height.

Above is the summary for the given data and the following is the final predicted result.
